# Editor Section
The editor section is where all the *“magic”* in mage happens. The editor page allows users to create microservices, add micro-components to the service, connect them together and therefore create a full-fledged microservice-based backend system.

On the editor page a user is allowed to:
- Create a new microservice (using the toolbar on top).
- Selectively add components by clicking them from the left Components section and adding them with a name to the editor.
- Connecting these components in a logical manner in order that makes sense for the application.
- Configure these components by double-clicking on every individual component in the canvas and then configuring them in the side drawer.

Additionally, **Mage caches your UI actions every few seconds** and syncs the configuration snapshot so that even if the user closes the window by mistake, they are able to resume from where they left. The title bar always shows a time ticker which denotes the last time configurations were cached.
Once satisfied with changes, users can click on the save button on the title bar which saves the user’s configuration for the selected microservice.
